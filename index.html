        <p>Consider	hunger.	How	do	you	know	when	you’re	hungry?	You	don’t necessarily	have	to	see	a	cookie	on	the	counter	to	realize	that	it	is	time to	eat.	Appetite	and	hunger	are	governed	nonconsciously.	Your	body has	a	variety	of	feedback	loops	that	gradually	alert	you	when	it	is	time to	eat	again	and	that	track	what	is	going	on	around	you	and	within	you. Cravings	can	arise	thanks	to	hormones	and	chemicals	circulating
    through	your	body.	Suddenly,	you’re	hungry	even	though	you’re	not quite	sure	what	tipped	you	off. It’s	also	what	makes	them	dangerous.	As	habits	form,	your	actions come	under	the	direction	of	your	automatic	and	nonconscious	mind. You	fall	into	old	patterns	before	you	realize	what’s	happening.	Unless someone	points	it	out,	you	may	not	notice	that	you	cover	your	mouth with	your	hand	whenever	you	laugh,	that	you	apologize	before	asking	a question,	or	that	you	have	a	habit	of	finishing	other	people’s	sentences. </p>

        Museum	curators	have	been	known	to	discern	the	difference between	an	authentic	piece	of	art	and	an	expertly	produced	counterfeit even	though	they	can’t	tell	you	precisely	which	details	tipped	them	off. Experienced	radiologists	can	look	at	a	brain	scan	and	predict	the	area where	a	stroke	will	develop	before	any	obvious	signs	are	visible	to	the untrained	eye.	I’ve	even	heard	of	hairdressers

        With	enough	practice,	you	can	pick	up	on	the	cues	that	predict certain	outcomes	without	consciously	thinking	about	it.	Automatically, your	brain	encodes	the	lessons	learned	through	experience.	We	can’t always	explain	what	it	is	we	are	learning,	but	learning	is	happening	all along	the	way,	and	your	ability	to	notice	the	relevant	cues	in	a	given situation	is	the	foundation	for	every	habit	you	have.
